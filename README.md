# 🕵️‍♂️ Steganography: Hiding Messages in Plain Sight

Ever wanted to pass secret messages James Bond-style? In this lab, I explore the art of **steganography**, where I embed hidden messages and files within innocent-looking images and audio. It's not just digital magic; it's science!

## 🔍 What I Did:
1. **Hiding Text in Images**: Using tools like `steghide` and `nano`, I tucked away secret messages in images. It’s like putting a sticky note in a painting that only you can read!
2. **Hiding Multiple Files in an Image**: Why stop at one? I also zipped and hid multiple files inside an image—because secrets are best kept layered, right?
3. **Steganography in Audio**: Not a fan of pictures? I hid a message in an audio file using SteGUI. Because who says sound can’t carry secrets?

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade:
- **Kali Linux**: The ultimate hacker’s toolkit.
- **Steghide & SteGUI**: My trusty steganography tools.
- **Terminal Commands**: Keeping things sleek and efficient.

## Why This Matters:
In the world of cybersecurity, hiding and retrieving data covertly is a valuable skill. Steganography allows messages to fly under the radar, ensuring private communications remain private.
